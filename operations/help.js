{blue ${chalk.bold('Arguments')}:}
  The available operations are listed. Most operations can take a string as an additional argument. The containers are matched against this string and the first match is returned.
  Example: {bgGray ${chalk.green('dev build subscr')}} results in building the subscription-api whereas {bgGray ${chalk.green('dev build')}} iterates over all containers and build them.

{blue ${chalk.bold('Operations')}:}
